Team project for ITEC 2905

Users enter a park name and month, the program returns the official park name and the park description from the National Park API.
It also returns average high and low temperatures and average precipitation for that park zip code for the entered month from the visual crossing API.
It returns distance to the park latitude and longitude from Minneapolis using the Open Route Service API.

Future enhancements might include:
Add database to allow bookmarking
Add more unit tests
Add additional error handling
Update menu options
Add ability to enter a starting location
Add ability to specify dates and choose display options full month of data or summary
